# NodeJS_Angular
See description for branch master

This project uses NodeJS Angular6 MongoDB Atlas Express.

I added a Node Js server to my Angular project (master branch).
Using the proxy.config.json configuration file, I redirected all rest api requests to the server created on Nodejs
When deploying a project in the color tab, it is possible to save, delete and edit the list of colors, which is directly connected to the MongoDB Atlas database.
